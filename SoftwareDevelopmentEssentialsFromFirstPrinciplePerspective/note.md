## 4 pillars

### 1. Refinement
- You can always make your code better, there's no need to aim for perfection
- Be aware of diminshing returns
- Don't get attached, when you're stuck, kill your design and do it again.

### 2. Clarity
- It depends on ... what?
- Seek clarity
- Question your own interpretation
- Think backwards; Start at the end, where you want to be
- What is more important than How, clarify before you code
- Leverage mental model based in reality to constrain your thinking

### 3. Perpose
- Understand your value
- Understand your role
- Understand your craft
- Understand your tools

### 4. Experience
- Junior and Senior are irrelevant
- Reference experiences are king
- You must take matters on your own hands, apply this on your time, not just at work
- Prioritize continual learning, swap out old tools and approaches for better ones, develop a stack of tools and mental models for rapid development
- The cost of Mastery is dedication, discipline & continually returning to the path
